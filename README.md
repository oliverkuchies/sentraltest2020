Welcome to the Sentral Event Manager created by Oliver Kucharzewski.

This project was created solely for a test and serves no other purpose.

**Building instructions**

1) In-order to build the project, pull the latest repository from Github with git clone https://github.com/oliverkuchies/sentraltest2020.git

2) You will then need to create a database..

3) In the dump folder you can find a dump of SQL sample data to kick off the application. Please insert these into the database.

4) Once this has been completed, run composer install on the project to install PHPUnit for unit testing.

5) Afterwards, run npm install to download the latest npm files required for the project.

6) You can run a fresh build by writing npm run build after installing all necessary appplications.

7) Change the config in app/Models/Model.php to suit your database connection details.

8) Once complete, start entering your own events through the events page at /#/events/add. 

8) Enjoy the app :)
